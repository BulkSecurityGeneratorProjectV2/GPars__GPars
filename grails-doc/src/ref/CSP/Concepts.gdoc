The CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) concurrency concept provides a message-passing model with synchronous rendezvous-type
communication. It is valued mainly for its high level of determinism and the ability to compose parallel processes.
GPars' GroovyCSP wraps the "JCSP library":http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/ofa/jcsp/ and builds on the work of
"Jon Kerridge":http://www.iidi.napier.ac.uk/people/op/onepeople/peopleid/51 .
