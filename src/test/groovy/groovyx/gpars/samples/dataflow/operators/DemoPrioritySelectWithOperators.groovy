/**
 * Shows a possible way to combine operators with PrioritySelectors.
 * Note that dataflow variables and streams can be combined for Selectors.
 * Unlike plain Selector, the PrioritySelector class gives precedence to input channels with lower index.
 * Available messages from high priority channels will be served before messages from lower-priority channels.
 * Messages received through a single input channel will have their mutual order preserved.
 *
 * Operators can take output from a Select or PrioritySelect as one of its (many) inputs, allowing channel prioritization
 * to be built into dataflow operator networks.
