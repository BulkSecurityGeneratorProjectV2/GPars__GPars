/**
 * Dataflow selectors and operators (processors) form the basic units in dataflow networks. They are typically combined into oriented graphs that transform data.
 * They accept a set of input and output dataflow channels so that once values are available to be consumed in any
 * of the input channels the selector's body is triggered on the values, potentially generating values to be written into the output channels.
 * The output channels at the same time are suitable to be used as input channels by some other dataflow processors.
 * The channels allow processors to communicate.
 *
 * Dataflow selectors and operators enable creation of highly concurrent applications yet the abstraction hides the low-level concurrency primitives
 * and exposes much friendlier API.
 * Since selectors and operators internally leverage the actor implementation, they reuse a pool of threads and so the actual number of threads
 * used by the calculation can be kept much lower than the actual number of processors used in the network.
 *
 * Selectors select a random value from the values available in the input channels. Optionally the selector's guards mask
 * can be altered to limit the number of channels considered for selection.
