 * Allows repeatedly receive a value across multiple dataflow channels.
 * Whenever a value is available in any of the channels, the value becomes available on the Select itself
 * through its val property.
 * Alternatively timed getVal method can be used, as well as getValAsync() for asynchronous value retrieval
 * or the call() method for nicer syntax.
 * <p/>
 * The output values can also be consumed through the channel obtained from the getOutputChannel method.
 * <p/>
 * Implementations may vary in how they order incoming values on their output.
