/**
 * Offers a deterministic one-to-many and many-to-many messaging alternative to DataflowQueue.
 * Internally it wraps a DataflowStream class with a DataflowStreamWriteAdapter and so
 * synchronizes all writes to the underlying stream allowing multiple threads accessing the stream concurrently.
 * On demand through the createReadChannel() method it will return an DataflowReadChannel through which the reader will receive
 * all messages written to the channel since then.
 * <p/>
 * Typical use:
 * <p/>
 * DataflowWriteChannel broadcastStream = new DataflowBroadcast()
 * DataflowReadChannel stream1 = broadcastStream.createReadChannel()
 * DataflowReadChannel stream2 = broadcastStream.createReadChannel()
 * broadcastStream << 'Message'
 * assert stream1.val == stream2.val
 *
 * @param <T> The type of messages to pass through the stream
