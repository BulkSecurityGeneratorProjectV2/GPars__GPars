/**
 * {@code AbstractPooledActor} provides the default implementation of a stateful actor. Refer to {@code
 * DynamicDispatchActor} or {@code ReactiveActor} for examples of stateless actors.  {@code
 * AbstractPooledActor} represents a standalone active object (actor), which reacts asynchronously to
 * messages sent to it from outside through the {@code send} method, which preserving its internal implicit
 * state.  Each {@code Actor} has its own message queue and a thread pool shared with other {@code Actor}s
 * by means of an instance of the {@code PGroup}, which they have in common.  The {@code PGroup} instance is
 * responsible for the pool creation, management and shutdown.  All work performed by an {@code Actor} is
 * divided into chunks, which are sequentially submitted as independent tasks to the thread pool for
 * processing.  Whenever an {@code Actor} looks for a new message through the {@code react} method, the
 * actor gets detached from the thread, making the thread available for other actors. Thanks to the ability
 * to dynamically attach and detach threads to actors, {@code Actors} can scale far beyond the limits of the
 * underlying platform on number of concurrently available threads.  The {@code receive} method can be used
 * to read a message from the queue without giving up the thread. If no message is available, the call to
 * {@code receive} blocks until a message arrives or the supplied timeout expires.  The {@code loop} method
 * allows to repeatedly invoke a closure and yet perform each of the iterations sequentially in different
 * thread from the thread pool.  To support continuations correctly the {@code react} and {@code loop}
 * methods never return.
 *
 * <pre>
 * import static groovyx.gpars.actor.Actors.actor
 * 
 * def actor = actor {
 *     loop {
 *         react { message ->
 *             println message
 *         }
 *         // This line will never be reached.
 *     }
 *     // This line will never be reached.
 * }.start()
 * 
 * actor.send 'Hi!'
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This requires the code to be structured accordingly.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * def adder = actor {
 *     loop {
 *         react { a ->
 *             react { b ->
 *                 println a+b
 *                 replyIfExists a+b  // Sends reply, if b was sent by a PooledActor.
 *             }
 *         }
 *         // This line will never be reached.
 *     }
 *     // This line will never be reached.
 * }.start()
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The closures passed to the {@code react} method can call {@code reply} or {@code replyIfExists}, which
 * will send a message back to the originator of the currently processed message. The {@code replyIfExists}
 * method unlike the {@code reply} method will not fail if the original message wasn't sent by an actor nor
 * if the original sender actor is no longer running.  The {@code reply} and {@code replyIfExists} methods
 * are also dynamically added to the processed messages.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * react { a ->
 *     react { b ->
 *         reply 'message'  //sent to senders of a as well as b
 *         a.reply 'private message'  //sent to the sender of a only
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The {@code react} method accepts timeouts as well.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * react(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES) {
 *     println 'Received message: ' + it
 * }
 * </pre>
 *<p>
 * If no message arrives within the given timeout, the {@code onTimeout} lifecycle handler is invoked, if
 * exists, and the {@code Actor.TIMEOUT} message is returned.  Each {@code Actor} has at any point in time
 * at most one active instance of {@code ActorAction} associated, which abstracts the current chunk of
 * actor's work to perform. Once a thread is assigned to the {@code ActorAction}, it moves the actor forward
 * till {@code loop} or {@code react} is called. These methods schedule another {@code ActorAction} for
 * processing and throw dedicated exception to terminate the current {@code ActorAction}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each Actor can define lifecycle observing methods, which will be called by the Actor's background thread
 * whenever a certain lifecycle event occurs.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code afterStart()} - called immediately after the {@code Actor}'s background thread has been
 * started, before the {@code act} method is called the first time.</li>
 * <li>{@code afterStop(List undeliveredMessages)} - called right after the actor is stopped, passing in all
 * the messages from the queue.</li>
 * <li>{@code onInterrupt(InterruptedException e)} - called when a {@code react} method timeouts. The actor
 * will be terminated.</li>
 * <li>{@code onTimeout()} - called when the actor's thread gets interrupted. Thread interruption will
 * result in the stopping the actor in any case.</li>
 * <li>{@code onException(Throwable e)} - called when an exception occurs in the actor's thread. Throwing an
 * exception from this method will stop the actor.</li>
 * </ul>
